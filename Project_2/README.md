This is a basic command-line calculator project written in Python. It allows users to perform simple arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, floor division, and modulus. The calculator continues to prompt for input until the user chooses to quit.

## Features

- Addition (`+`)
- Subtraction (`-`)
- Multiplication (`*`)
- Division (`/`)
- Floor Division (`//`)
- Modulus (`%`)
- Input validation for numbers
- Option to quit by entering `q` as the operator

## How to Use

1. Run the script:
    ```
    python calculator.py
    ```
2. Enter the first number when prompted.
3. Enter the second number when prompted.
4. Enter the operator (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `//`, `%`) or `q` to quit.
5. The result will be displayed. Repeat steps 2â€“4 as needed.

## Example
